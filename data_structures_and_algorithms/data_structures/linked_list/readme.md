# Singly Linked List

Linked List
In computer science, a linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence

## Challenge

insert ,include ,toString.
we should define these three methood usning Linked-List

## Approach & Efficiency

it took about 6 h

## API

insert method : takes any value as an argument then it add a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.

includes methood:  takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.

 __str__  method : takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"
