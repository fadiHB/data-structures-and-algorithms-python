# Trees

Binary Tree and BST Implementation

## Challenge

Define a method for each of the depth first traversals called preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.

Create a BinarySearchTree class
Define a method named add that accepts a value, and adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
Define a method named contains that accepts a value, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.

## Approach & Efficiency

using recursion

## API

| Method | Time | Space |
| :----------- | :----------- | :----------- |
| preOrder |log(n) | log(n) |
| inOrder |log(n) | log(n) |
| postOrder |log(n) | log(n) |
| add |log(n) | log(n) |
| contains |log(n) | log(n) |
